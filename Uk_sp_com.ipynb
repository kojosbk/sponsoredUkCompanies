    "## Introduction <a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis aims to uncover insights from UK visa sponsorship data. The data contains information on organizations sponsoring foreign nationals for UK visas across multiple categories like Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility, Creative Occupations etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement <a id=\"problem\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The UK has a robust visa system to allow organizations to sponsor foreign talent. The key questions this analysis will address are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which regions attract the most visa sponsors and why? \n",
    "- What are the most common visa routes being sponsored?\n",
    "- How do creative visas compare to skilled worker visas?\n",
    "- Are there any trends over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Goals <a id=\"goals\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals are to analyze regional trends, study patterns across visa routes, develop visualizations and build a model to predict future visa volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Overview <a id=\"data\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains information on sponsoring organizations including name, location, visa type & rating and specific visa route. This will help address the key questions and uncover regional and visa-type specific trends.\n",

    "## Data Cleaning <a id=\"cleaning\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "As the first step, the raw CSV data is loaded into a Pandas dataframe for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset requires some cleansing and preprocessing before analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle missing values - Rows with critical missing fields like location or visa type are dropped\n",
    "- Normalize organization names - Organization names are standardized for aggregation/analysis\n",
    "- Add region column - A new column is generated using the location data to define region\n",
    "- Visa category - Broad visa categories created like Skilled, Business, Creative etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning, the dataframe will be ready for exploratory analysis and visualizations. Key steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assess missing data \n",
    "- Fill/drop missing values appropriately\n",
    "- Perform transformations like normalize, generate new columns etc.\n",
    "- Validate corrections to ensure quality\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result is a clean, consistent dataset with all the required fields to drive further analysis on regional trends and visa category comparisons."
